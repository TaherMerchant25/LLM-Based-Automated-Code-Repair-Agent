BUG LOCATION: Line 4: `while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Wrong comparison operator.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The condition `abs(x - approx) > epsilon` checks if the absolute difference between `x` and the approximation `approx` is *greater* than `epsilon`.  The Newton-Raphson method aims to find an approximation where the *square* of the approximation is within `epsilon` of `x`. The current condition checks the difference between `x` and the approximation, not the difference between `x` and the *square* of the approximation.  This leads to inaccurate results, especially for larger values of `x`.  The algorithm might terminate prematurely, failing to reach the desired accuracy.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The loop termination condition should check the absolute difference between `x` and the *square* of `approx`, i.e., `abs(x - approx*approx) > epsilon`. This ensures that the approximation's square is within the specified tolerance of `x`.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
