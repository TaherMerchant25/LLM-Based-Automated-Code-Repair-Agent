BUG LOCATION: Line 7: `while lo <= hi:`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Off-by-one error in loop bounds.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The loop condition `lo <= hi` allows `mid` to potentially go out of bounds when `lo` and `hi` are equal.  When `lo` and `hi` are equal, `mid` will be equal to `lo` (and `hi`). If the element at `mid` is not the target, the algorithm will attempt to access `arr[mid-1]` which will cause an IndexError if `mid` is 0.  Even if `mid` is not 0, the logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the case where the target element is at the beginning of the array.  The correct termination condition should prevent accessing indices outside the array bounds.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The loop should terminate when `lo` becomes greater than `hi`. This ensures that the algorithm never attempts to access an index outside the valid range of the array.  The correct loop condition should be `lo < hi`.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
