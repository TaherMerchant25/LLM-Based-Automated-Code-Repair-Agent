ALGORITHM PURPOSE: The algorithm aims to convert an arithmetic expression from infix notation (e.g., 1 + 2) to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN, also known as postfix notation, e.g., 1 2 +) using Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Lines 14-16\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Wrong loop termination condition\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The `while` loop on lines 14-16 only pops operators from `opstack` and appends them to `rpntokens` if the current token's precedence is less than or equal to the precedence of the top operator on the stack.  It *never* pushes the current token onto the `opstack`. This means operators are only processed if they have lower or equal precedence than the operator at the top of the stack, ignoring the case where the current operator has higher precedence and should be pushed onto the stack.  The algorithm effectively ignores the pushing of operators onto the stack, leading to an incorrect RPN conversion.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The `while` loop should only pop operators from the `opstack` if their precedence is greater than or equal to the current token's precedence. After the `while` loop, the current token (operator) should be pushed onto the `opstack`. This ensures that operators with higher precedence are processed later, following the correct order of operations.  The correct code would include pushing the current token onto `opstack` after the while loop.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
