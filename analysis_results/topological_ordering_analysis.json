BUG LOCATION: Lines 6-8 (the inner loop)\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect logical condition in loop.  Specifically, it uses an overly restrictive condition for adding nodes to the `ordered_nodes` list.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The condition `set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes)` checks if *all* outgoing nodes of `nextnode` are already in `ordered_nodes`. This is too strict.  A node should be added to the `ordered_nodes` list if *all* its incoming nodes are already in `ordered_nodes`, not its outgoing nodes.  The algorithm incorrectly considers outgoing nodes instead of incoming nodes when determining if a node is ready to be added to the sorted list.  This leads to incomplete or incorrect topological ordering, especially in graphs with more complex dependencies.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The inner loop should check if all incoming nodes of `nextnode` are present in `ordered_nodes` before appending `nextnode`.  The condition should be changed to something like `set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes)`.  A proper topological sort algorithm iteratively adds nodes whose dependencies (incoming nodes) have already been processed.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
