BUG LOCATION: Line 16: `queue.extend(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen)`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect variable reference/scope issue and logical error.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The line `queue.extend(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen)` attempts to add only unseen successors to the queue. However, it uses `node` as the variable in the generator expression, which refers to the current node being processed, not the successor nodes themselves.  This means the condition `node not in nodesseen` always checks if the *current* node is in `nodesseen`, not the *successor* nodes.  Furthermore, even if it correctly checked the successor nodes, it adds the *node* itself to the queue, not the successor.  The correct approach is to add the successor nodes to the queue and mark them as seen.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The code should iterate through the `node.successors`, check if each *successor* node is already in `nodesseen`, and add only the unseen successors to the queue.  The `nodesseen` set should be updated with all successor nodes, regardless of whether they were added to the queue (because they might already be in the queue).\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
