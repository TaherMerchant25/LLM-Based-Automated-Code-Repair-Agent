BUG LOCATION: Line 9: `for i, count in enumerate(arr):`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect variable reference.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The loop iterates through the original unsorted array `arr` instead of the `counts` array which holds the frequency of each element.  `enumerate(arr)` yields pairs of indices and values from the input array, not the counts of each element.  Therefore, the code uses the wrong values to determine how many times each element should be appended to `sorted_arr`.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The loop should iterate through the `counts` array.  For each element `i` in `counts`, it should append `i` to `sorted_arr` exactly `counts[i]` times. This correctly reflects the frequency of each element in the input array.  The correct loop should be: `for i, count in enumerate(counts):`\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
