BUG LOCATION: Line 7: `return [[first] + subset for subset in rest_subsets]`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect base case handling in recursive function.  The recursive step is correct, but the base case produces an incomplete powerset.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The code correctly recursively builds subsets by adding the first element to each subset of the rest of the list. However, the base case `else: return [[]]` only returns the empty set.  It fails to include the empty set in the final result when the input list is not empty.  The recursive calls correctly build subsets, but the final result is missing the subsets that don't include the first element from each recursive step.  The problem is not in the recursive logic itself, but in how the results of the recursion are combined.  The empty set should be included in the final result *at each level* of recursion, not just when the input is empty.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The function should return a list of lists containing all possible subsets of the input list.  The correct powerset for `['a', 'b', 'c']` should be `[[], ['a'], ['b'], ['c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a', 'c'], ['b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c']]`. The current implementation is missing subsets that don't include the first element at each recursive step.  The empty set should be present in the final result, and it should be combined with the subsets generated from the recursive calls.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
