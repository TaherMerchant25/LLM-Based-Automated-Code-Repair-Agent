BUG LOCATION: Line 6-7: `lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])` and `greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Missing handling of equal elements.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The code only handles elements less than or greater than the pivot.  Elements equal to the pivot are ignored, leading to an incomplete sort.  If the input list contains duplicate elements, these duplicates will not be placed correctly in the sorted output.  The algorithm will produce a partially sorted list.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  The algorithm should correctly handle elements equal to the pivot.  These elements should be included in either the `lesser` or `greater` lists (it doesn't matter which, as long as it's consistent), or a separate list for equal elements could be created and concatenated.  The corrected code should ensure all elements are considered and placed in their correct sorted position.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
