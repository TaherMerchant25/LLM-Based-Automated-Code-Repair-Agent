Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Line 7: `upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Off-by-one error in array indexing.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The `upleft` calculation uses `c - 1` as the index for the previous row. When `c` is 0 (the first element of a row), `c - 1` becomes -1, which is an invalid index, causing an `IndexError`.  The code attempts to handle this with the `if c > 0 else 0` condition, but this is insufficient because it only handles the case where `c` is 0.  The problem is that the first element of each row (except the first row) should be 1, which is the element directly above it.  The logic incorrectly assumes that the first element's upper left neighbor is 0.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The `upleft` value should always be accessible within the bounds of the previous row.  For the first element of each row (except the first row), `upleft` should be the first element of the previous row (index 0). The current logic incorrectly sets it to 0.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
