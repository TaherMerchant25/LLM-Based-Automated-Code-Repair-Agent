VALIDATION RESPONSE:
------------------------------
VALIDATION: FAILED
ISSUES: The fix in the provided "fixed" code is incomplete. While the `1 +` was correctly removed from the `elif` block, the base case handling is still flawed.  The line `return len(source) or len(target)` is incorrect. If one string is empty, the Levenshtein distance should be the length of the other string, not the boolean result of `len(source) or len(target)`.  This will return 0 if both strings are empty, which is correct, but will return the length of the non-empty string only if one is empty, not the other.  This is a subtle but crucial error.

CORRECTED_CODE:
```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if len(source) == 0:
        return len(target)
    if len(target) == 0:
        return len(source)

    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])

    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)
        )

Levenshtein Distance


Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.  The Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum amount of single-character edits (either removing a character, adding a character, or changing a character) necessary to transform a source string into a target string.

Input:
    source: The string you begin with.
    target: The string to transform into.

Output:
    The Levenshtein distance between the source and target.

Example:
    electron can be transformed into neutron by removing the e, turning the l into n, and turning the c into u.
    >>> levenshtein(electron, neutron)
    3
