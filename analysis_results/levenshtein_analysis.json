This is the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Line 6\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect base case handling in recursive function.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The line `return 1 + levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])` is incorrect when `source[0] == target[0]`.  It should return the Levenshtein distance of the remaining substrings *plus zero*, not plus one. Adding 1 in this case incorrectly increments the edit distance even when the first characters match, implying an unnecessary edit.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: When the first characters of `source` and `target` are equal, the Levenshtein distance is simply the distance between the remaining substrings.  The recursive call should be `return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])`.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
