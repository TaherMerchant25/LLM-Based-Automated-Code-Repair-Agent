BUG LOCATION: Line 6: `yield flatten(x)`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect recursive call within the `else` block.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When a non-list element `x` is encountered, the code recursively calls `flatten(x)`.  This is incorrect because `flatten` expects a list as input.  Applying `flatten` to a non-list element will lead to an infinite recursion if the element is not a list, or will yield a generator that yields the element itself, which is not the intended behavior. The function should simply yield the non-list element directly.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:  The `else` block should simply yield the non-list element `x` without recursively calling `flatten`.  The recursive call should only happen when `x` is a list.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
