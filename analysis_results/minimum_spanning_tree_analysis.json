It takes a dictionary where keys are edges (tuples of nodes) and values are edge weights, and returns a set of edges forming the MST.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Lines 11-14\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect update of the `group_by_node` dictionary.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The code incorrectly updates the `group_by_node` dictionary.  When merging two groups, it iterates through `group_by_node[v]` and updates each node's group with `group_by_node[u]`. However, it also updates `group_by_node[u]` with `group_by_node[v]` *for each node in `group_by_node[v]`*. This leads to redundant and potentially incorrect updates, causing cycles to be missed and incorrect edges to be added to the MST.  The update should be a single union operation, not repeated for each node.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The `group_by_node` dictionary should be updated by performing a single union operation between `group_by_node[u]` and `group_by_node[v]`.  This can be achieved by using the `update()` method only once after the initial `group_by_node[u].update(group_by_node[v])` operation.  The loop on lines 13-14 is unnecessary and incorrect.\n\n6.
