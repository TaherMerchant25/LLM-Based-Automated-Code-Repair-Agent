  "validation_response": "VALIDATION: FAILED\nISSUES: The fix in the provided \"fixed\" code is incomplete. While the `1 +` was correctly removed from the `elif` block, the base case handling is still flawed.  The line `return len(source) or len(target)` is incorrect. If one string is empty, the Levenshtein distance should be the length of the other string, not the boolean result of `len(source) or len(target)`.  This will return 0 if both strings are empty, which is correct, but will return the length of the non-empty string only if one is empty, not the other.  This is a subtle but crucial error.\n\nCORRECTED_CODE:\n```python\ndef levenshtein(source, target):\n    if len(source) == 0:\n        return len(target)\n    if len(target) == 0:\n        return len(source)\n\n    elif source[0] == target[0]:\n        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])\n\n    else:\n        return 1 + min(\n            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),\n            levenshtein(source[1:], target)\n        )\n \n\"\"\"\nLevenshtein Distance\n\n\nCalculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.
