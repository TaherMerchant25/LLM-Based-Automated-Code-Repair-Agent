PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The `while True` loop continues indefinitely.  The algorithm relies on the `hare` pointer eventually meeting the `tortoise` pointer if a cycle exists. However, if there's no cycle, the `hare` pointer will reach the end of the list (`hare.successor is None`), causing a `AttributeError` because it attempts to access `hare.successor.successor` before checking if `hare.successor` is None.  The loop should terminate when the `hare` reaches the end of the list *before* the `hare` and `tortoise` meet.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The loop should terminate when either the `hare` reaches the end of the list (detecting no cycle) or when the `hare` and `tortoise` pointers meet (detecting a cycle).  The condition `hare.successor is None` should be checked *before* accessing `hare.successor.successor`.  A more robust solution would be to check `hare is None` or `hare.successor is None` before accessing `hare.successor`.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
