ALGORITHM PURPOSE: The algorithm aims to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, returning a list of steps (disk moves) to transfer a stack of disks from a starting peg to an ending peg.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Line 7: `helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect handling of edge cases; potential for `KeyError`\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The line uses set difference to find the helper peg.  `.pop()` arbitrarily selects an element from the resulting set. While this works for most cases, if `height` is 0, the function recursively calls itself with `height -1` which eventually leads to an empty set.  Attempting to `.pop()` from an empty set raises a `KeyError`.  The algorithm doesn't handle the base case (height=0) gracefully.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: When `height` is 0, the function should immediately return an empty list (`[]`), signifying no moves are needed.  This base case should prevent the `KeyError`.  The code should handle the case where the set difference results in an empty set.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
