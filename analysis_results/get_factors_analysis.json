BUG TYPE: Incorrect loop termination condition and incomplete factorization.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The algorithm only considers factors up to the square root of n.  If a factor larger than the square root exists, it will not be found.  The algorithm also only returns a single factor when it finds one, instead of recursively finding the factors of the remaining quotient.  This leads to incomplete factorization when a number has prime factors larger than its square root or when a prime factor is repeated. For example, if n=100, it finds 2, then recursively calls get_factors(50), finds 2 again, then recursively calls get_factors(25), and then returns an empty list because 25 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 5.  It should continue to find 5 and 5.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The algorithm should correctly identify all prime factors of the input number `n`, regardless of their magnitude or repetition.  It should continue to factor the quotient until it reaches 1.  A more robust approach would be to iterate until `n` becomes 1, dividing by the smallest prime factor found at each step.\n\n6.
