It aims to efficiently find the largest sum possible from a sequence of numbers, allowing for negative numbers within the sequence.\n\n2. BUG LOCATION: Line 7: `max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x`  and implicitly, the initialization `max_ending_here = 0`\n\n3. BUG TYPE: Incorrect initialization and accumulation leading to incorrect handling of all negative numbers.\n\n4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The algorithm fails when the input list contains only negative numbers.  The initialization of `max_ending_here` to 0, and the subsequent addition of each element, means that if all numbers are negative, `max_so_far` will remain 0.  The algorithm should return the largest single negative number in such cases.  The algorithm incorrectly assumes there will always be at least one non-negative number or a sequence that sums to a non-negative number.\n\n5. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: The algorithm should correctly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous sublist, even if all numbers in the input list are negative.  In the case of all negative numbers, it should return the largest (least negative) number in the list. For example, `max_sublist_sum([-1,-2,-3])` should return -1.\n\n6. CONFIDENCE: High",
