All Shortest Paths
floyd-warshall

Floyd-Warshall algorithm implementation.

Calculates the length of the shortest path connecting every ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph.



Input:
    n: The number of nodes in the graph. The nodes are assumed to have ids 0..n-1
    length_by_edge: A dict containing edge length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids

Precondition:
    There are no negative-length cycles in the input graph

Output:
    A dict containing shortest path length keyed by an ordered pair of node ids
