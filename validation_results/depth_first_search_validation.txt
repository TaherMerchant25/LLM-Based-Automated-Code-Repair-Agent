VALIDATION RESPONSE:
------------------------------
VALIDATION: FAILED
ISSUES: The fix is partially correct but still has a subtle flaw.  While moving `nodesvisited.add(node)` after the recursive call prevents infinite loops in many cases, it doesn't guarantee correctness for all scenarios, particularly when dealing with disconnected graphs or graphs with multiple paths to the goal node. The `any()` function short-circuits; if the first successor leads to the goal, the rest are not explored, and nodes in those unexplored branches remain unvisited. This can lead to incorrect results if the goal is reachable through another path that involves those unvisited nodes.  The algorithm needs to explore all paths from a node before marking it as visited to ensure completeness.

CORRECTED_CODE:
```python
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()
 
    def search_from(node):
        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        nodesvisited.add(node) #Added here to ensure all paths from a node are explored before marking it as visited.
        result = False
        for nextnode in node.successors:
            if nextnode not in nodesvisited: #Check for visited nodes before recursive call
                result = result or search_from(nextnode)
        return result

    return search_from(startnode)
```

        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        nodesvisited.add(node) #Added here to ensure all paths from a node are explored before marking it as visited.
        result = False
        for nextnode in node.successors:
            if nextnode not in nodesvisited: #Check for visited nodes before recursive call
                result = result or search_from(nextnode)
        return result

    return search_from(startnode)
